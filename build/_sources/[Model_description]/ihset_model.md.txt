# Model formulation

## Overview

In the literature there are multiple proposals for shoreline models, such as static and dynamic equilibrium models in plan and beach profile, as well as 3D, multiline, one-line or one-line evolution models, conceptual models or models tending to equilibrium and hybrid or combined models. The present project focuses on proposals for static and dynamic equilibrium and conceptual or equilibrium models, for short or diagnostic studies, as well as detailed studies considering variability and uncertainties, and one-line and hybrid models, for detailed studies, which are computationally efficient, for medium, long and very long term projections. The following is a brief description of the models available in the above typologies, highlighting the proposals developed by the IGC Group:

### Models of static and dynamic beach equilibrium conditions

Several authors have been interested in proposing empirical formulations, which attempt to reproduce the static equilibrium conditions of both the profile and the plan shape of the beach. Regarding the profile, there are proposals for one section (e.g. Dean 1991), two sections (e.g. Bernabeu 1999) or even three sections (e.g. Requejo et al., 2008).

On the other hand, in terms of plan shape, there are numerous proposals considering expressions such as logarithmic spiral (e.g. Silvester 1960), parabolic (e.g. Hsu and Evans 1989; Gonz√°lez and Medina 2001; Elshinnawy et al., 2022) or hyperbolic tangent (e.g. Moreno and Kraus 1999). Despite the advantages and simplicity of the analytical formulations indicated above, these are not applicable in study sites with irregularities or obstacles in the bathymetry (reefs, rocky slabs,...). In these cases, the proposal presented by Gainza et al. (2018) is applicable.

### Models of shoreline evolution tending to equilibrium

These models are conceptually based on the equilibrium between destructive and constructive forces acting on a beach. And they allow to obtain the position of the shoreline at a given time, either due to the action of storms, seasonal changes and/or changes caused by interannual effects. The approach of these models can be decomposed according to the direction of sediment transport; longitudinal or transverse transport. In the literature, there are multiple proposals of this type of models that consider only the transverse displacement of the coast (e.g., Yates et al., 2009; Jara et al., 2015; Jaramillo et al. 2020).

On the other hand, there are few proposals that infer longitudinal processes. Among them, there are simplified models that reproduce changes in shoreline orientation and are mainly applicable to embedded beaches (e.g. Turki et al., 2013 and Jaramillo et al., 2021a). As an integration of both processes, we have the IH-MOOSE moel, proposed by Jaramillo et al., (2021b), which integrates cross-shore component, rotation, and parabolic plan shape expression, being a model clearly tending to equilibrium applicable to embedded beaches.

### One-line models.

One-line models are the most commonly used to estimate long-term mean changes due to longitudinal sediment transport. These models use the sediment conservation formulation considering turbulent flow and empirical longitudinal transport relationships, ignoring cross-shore transport. They assume that the profile maintains a constant shape that translocates seaward or landward during the simulations, which means that they cannot be applied for the analysis of short-term changes, in which transverse transport along the beach profile is significant. Within this typology, it is worth highlighting the CHRONOS model, developed by the IGC Group of IHCantabria. This is a one-line model that simulates medium- to long-term changes (years) including wave propagation with the Ref-Dif OLUCA and Refract models, updating the bathymetry for propagation and its evolution and preserving the sediment balance in the process.

### Hybrid models.

Hybrid models consist of shoreline evolution models that combine transverse and longitudinal transport processes, and are applicable on scales from days to decades. They are models of reduced complexity, with a reasonable computational cost, that assume a series of simplifying assumptions in accordance with the needs of the study. Examples of such models are the pioneering CosMos-COAST (Vitousek et al., 2017), IH-LANS (Alvarez-Cuesta et al., 2021) and IH-MOOSE (Jaramillo et al., 2021b). These hybrid models assume a number of simplifying assumptions that allow them to calculate changes considering both processes efficiently. However, their major limitation is that they do not preserve the sedimentary balance.

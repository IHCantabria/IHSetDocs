# IHSetDocs

This document outlines succinct technical descriptions of the chosen models, which will be seamlessly integrated into the Shoreline Evolution Tools (IH-SET). These modular tools empower engineers and coastal managers to investigate morphodynamic studies across diverse spatial and temporal ranges, be it within a project or while assessing a beach as a physiographic entity.
